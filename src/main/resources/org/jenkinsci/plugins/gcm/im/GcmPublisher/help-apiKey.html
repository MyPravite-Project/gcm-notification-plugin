<p>
On the "API Access" page for a project in the
<a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google APIs Console</a> you can find this value
under "<b>Key for server apps</b>", in the "<b>API key</b>" field.
</p>
<p>
If you don't already have a "Key for server apps" in your API project, then click the "Create new
Server key" button, then click "Create" on the dialog that appears. Ensure that you don't copy the
API key from the "Key for browser apps" section, if it exists.
