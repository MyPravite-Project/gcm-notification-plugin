In order for Jenkins to send notifications to your Android device, you need to register the device
with Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
If you're using the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crowflying.buildwatch">BuildWatch</a>
app, you can click the "Show QR code" button here, then scan it using the "Auto-setup" feature in
BuildWatch.
</p>
<p>
Clicking "Enter token manually" shows you the currently-configured device token. If you configure a
new token using the app, then you will need to refresh this page before you see the updated value.

A video walkthrough of the setup process can be found here:
